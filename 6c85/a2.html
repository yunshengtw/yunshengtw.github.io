<h3 id="dataset">Dataset</h3>
<p>The dataset used in this analysis includes all residential sales
transactions in the City of Boston between 2000-2023. It consists of 63
columns and 49301 rows. Important columns to this analysis include sale
date, sale price, sale price difference between consecutive transactions
in percentage, indicator for flipped properties, flip horizon, property
type, value investor type.</p>
<p>Some of the transactions has unreasonable/artificial price such as 1
and 999999999. Thus we remove them from the dataset, and end up with
49120 rows. There are some other data issues found in the dataset, for
instance, unreasonable high price percentage difference and negative
flip horizons. We discuss those issues and how we tackle them in the
section relevant to them.</p>

<h3 id="overall-housing-activity">Overall housing activity</h3>
<p>To understand housing activity in the City of Boston between
2000-2023, we begin with decomposing all the transactions by their
property type, and plot the housing price trends (i.e., mean price over
sale date in year) for the top-two popular property types as well as the
overall trend.</p>
<p><img src="./img/breakdown-and-price-trend.svg" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> In the City of Boston, the main properties
being traded are condos (more than 90%), followed by, but with a
significant gap, single-family homes. This is quite different from the
Homes for Profit reading where the analysis is done on the Greater
Boston residential area (53.9% for single-family homes and 33% for
condos). The overall housing price had been increasing over the years
until 2017, and since then the price seems to be decreasing. In
contrast, the prices of both single-family homes and condos has been
consistently increasing, with single-family homes enjoying a sharper
increase.</p>
<hr />
<p>To understand the “hotness” of the housing market, we plot the number
of all transactions and transactions involving flipped properties over
years.</p>
<p><img src="./img/hotness.svg" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 2.</strong> The overall housing activity seems
relatively stable over years, whereas the number of “flipping” spike
during the years of 2011-2014, and, despite experiencing a gradual drop
since 2015, remains high compared to years before 2011. These figures
indicate that flipping has become more or less a common practice in the
housing market.</p>
<h3 id="analysis-of-flipped-properties-and-their-transactions">Analysis
of flipped properties and their transactions</h3>
<p>To investigate further on flipping, we again decompose the
transactions, but this time only those that involve “flipped”
properties, by their property type. We then compare the result with the
overall activity.</p>
<p><img src="./img/breakdown-flip-txn.svg" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 3.</strong> The percentages of flipping generally
follows that of the overall activity, with condo on the top with a
proportion of 86.2%, and followed by single-family homes 3.8%. However,
the slightly lower ratio in condos and higher in single-family homes
compared to the overall activity might be explained by the fact that the
latter has been experiencing a steeper slope in price growth over the
years than the former, as demonstrated in Figure 1.</p>
<hr />
<p>To learn about how “fast” properties are being flipped, we plot the
flipping horizon, defined as the time elapsed between buying and selling
the flipped property, for condos and single-family homes, respectively.
We follow the definition in the metadata that refers to a flipping
horizon less than six months as “short-term”, between six months to a
year as “medium-term”, and between one to two years as “long-term”.</p>
<p>During plotting, we found that some transactions have negative
horizons. Removing them reduces the number of transaction analyzed in
this section from 1462 to 1440.</p>
<p><img src="./img/horizon.svg" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 4.</strong> For both flipped condos and single-family
homes, long-term horizons are the most common choice. Condos have
similar numbers of short-term and medium-term flipping, whereas
single-family homes are more likely to be flipped medium-term than
short-term.</p>
<hr />
<p>Next we dive into the housing price of flipped properties. At first
we tried to analyze all the transactions of interest as a whole, but
soon found it difficult to do so because of the huge discrepancy in the
price of properties. We therefore categorized the properties based on
their price: properties of price &lt; $400K belong to the low-priced
tier, $400K-1M the medium-priced tier, $1M-100M the high-priced tier. We
also observed extremely high-priced (&gt; $100M) properties that seem to
be unrelated to this analysis. Excluding them reduces the total number
of transactions by 92 and flipped transactions by 1.</p>
<p><img src="./img/housing-tier.svg" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 5.</strong> Flipped transactions have a medium-priced
ratio similar to that of overall transactions. However, flipped
transactions, in proportion, involves less low-priced properties
(flipped 9.1% vs. overall 24.8%) and more high-priced ones (flipped
46.6% vs. overall 29.2%).</p>
<p><img src="./img/housing-price.svg" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 6.</strong> Within each tier, the mean price of
flipped properties and that of all properties are close, but with the
former being slightly higher than the latter across all tiers.</p>
<h3 id="profit-from-flipped-properties">Profit from flipped
properties</h3>
<p>One reasonable hypothesis for the arise in flipping activity in the
past decade is that flipping is profitable. But how profitable is it? We
answer this question by first showing the distribution of “flipping”
profit, in terms of the percentage change in the price of a property
between consecutive transactions.</p>
<p><img src="./img/profit-overall.svg" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 7.</strong> Most of the profits range from -7% (the
10th percentile) to 76.5% (the 90th percentile), with the 25th
percentile = 3.3% and the 75th percentile = 27%.</p>
<hr />
<p>To probe into more detail of the profitability of flipped properties,
we analyze the profit within a greater granularity categorized by the
flipping horizon and the property price. We plot the mean price change
in percentage for each group.</p>
<p><img src="./img/profit-category.svg" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 8.</strong> Short-term flipped properties seem to be
slightly more profitable compared to the other two. This is particularly
surprising as that means the rate of return (i.e., profit divided by
time elapsed) is even higher. Moreover, the number (44% for at most 6
months) is remarkably high. As for the price groups, the difference
between groups become even more apparent. High-priced properties achieve
a 56% price increase on average, with medium-priced and low-priced 24%
and 22%, respectively. This phenomenon might explain why a huge portion
of flipped properties are high-priced, as shown in Figure 5.</p>
<h3 id="investor-activity">Investor activity</h3>
<p>Finally, we evaluate the investor activity by the number of
transactions conducted by investors. We plot the percentages of
transactions (overall and specific to the flipped ones, respectively)
made by different kinds of investors, as well as their selling activity
over time. Investors are categorized by the total purchase amount and
the number of purchased properties in any five-year period. Detail can
be found in the reading Homes for Profit.</p>
<p><img src="./img/seller-investor.svg" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 9.</strong> Overall, about 1/3 of properties are sold
by investors. The number of transactions seems relatively stable, except
for a brief rise around 2005-2007 before the Great Recession.</p>
<p><img src="./img/seller-investor-fp.svg" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 10.</strong> About half of the flipped properties are
sold by investors; a ratio exceeds the overall average. Also, a growing
trend in the number of transactions involving flipped properties
starting around 2011 suggests that investors are becoming more engaged
in flipping.</p>
<hr />
<p>As mentioned in the Homes for Profit reading, investors conduct more
cash sales than non-investors. To see if that’s also the case in this
dataset, we plot the cash sale ratio over time in all transactions and
then specialized to flipped properties.</p>
<p><img src="./img/cash.svg" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 11.</strong> Overall, investors have consistently
exhibited a higher cash sale ratio across years by a difference of
7-17%. This phenomenon becomes even more drastic when it comes to
flipped properties: 69% of investors purchase properties to be flipped
with cash, while only 32% of non-investors do so with cash.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In this analysis, we investigate the housing activity in the City of
Boston between 2000-2023, with a focus on “flipping” properties. We
found that flipping is indeed an active practice, especially for
properties with a growing trend in price such as condos and
single-family homes. Depending on many factors, including the property
type, the flip horizon, and the housing price, flipping can yield quite
different result. For instance, on average, flipping high-priced
properties can be more than two times more profitable than lower-priced
properties. Flipping can be extremely profitable. For instance, the
average profit one makes by flipping a property after six months is 44%.
Finally, investors with a large amount of cash are actively using this
advantage to purchase properties of their interest, perhaps with the
intention of flipping them rapidly.</p>
