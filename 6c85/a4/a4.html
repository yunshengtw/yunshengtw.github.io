<p><img src="./img/positive.svg" width="800" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Gender inequity manifests in several
aspects of women’s life in the U.S., including lower doctoral rate,
lower average salary, prevalent encountering of sexual harassment, and a
small body of representation in the top political realm.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>(-1)</em> Using a normalized scale for the x-axis in
<strong>Education</strong> enlarges the actual difference between men
and women. In particular, women with doctoral degrees accounts for 1.64%
of the entire female population and men 2.45%, but after normalization
the difference is 33%.</li>
<li><em>(2)</em> Showing a more comprehensive categories of sexual
harassment and job types in <strong>Life</strong> and
<strong>Salary</strong>, respectively, has the potential of increasing
the completeness of the study conducted in each of them.</li>
<li><em>(1)</em> Including the fact in <strong>Salary</strong> that
Payscale (i.e., the data source) is used by 59% of Fortune 500 offers a
more reliable foundation for the source.</li>
<li><em>(1)</em> Underlining the concrete numeric portion in the text

<li><em>(0)</em> The main proposition is placed around the middle and

<h3 id="against-the-proposition">AGAINST the Proposition</h3>
<p><img src="./img/negative.svg" width="800" /> <strong>Figure
2.</strong> Gender equity is no longer an issue in the U.S., as
evidenced by the similarity between men and women in many facets,
including enrollment rate in all levels of education, salary,
family-worker proportion, and labor participation rate.</p>
<h4 id="design-rationales-1">Design rationales</h4>
<p>Scale from fully deceptive (-2), neutral (0), to fully earnest
(2).</p>
<ul>
<li><em>(-1)</em> Using a scale from 0% to 100% in
<strong>Education</strong> makes the difference between men and women in
the doctoral category obscure.</li>
<li><em>(-2)</em> Reporting the <strong>Salary</strong> in controlled
groups (i.e., which consider job titles, experience, etc.) gives people
a false sense that men and women earn similarly. In reality, however,
men and women distribute quite differently in those groups, and such
information is completely lost.</li>
<li><em>(2)</em> Showing historical data in <strong>Life</strong> and
<strong>Work</strong> gives people a sense that the situation has
improved over time. Additionally, both of their text descriptions
mention the situation in the past to create some contrast.</li>
<li><em>(1)</em> Underlining the key takeaway message in each aspect has
the potential of conveying the impression that gender equity has indeed
been achieved in many aspects.</li>
<li><em>(-2)</em> The title (i.e., gender equity has been solved in the
U.S.) is a conclusion founded on unilateral and incomplete evidence.
More specifically, the <strong>Life</strong> and <strong>Work</strong>
aspects both focus on the quantitative side (i.e., how many women are in
family and how many working), but miss the qualitative side (e.g., how
women are treated in family and in work).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-reflection">Final Reflection</h2>
<p>I started out by reading the metadata of each table from the World
Bank, and chose the proposition about gender inequity because many of
the columns separate out female and male. At first I expected to find
evidence of gender inequity quite easily in the given data, but then
shockingly realized that it seems to point to the opposite
direction—many quantities such as education enrollment rates for women
and men are very close in more recent years. Recognizing this, I decided
to find some external data to support the chosen proposition. I figured
what seems to be the most often discussed topics in the context of
gender equity: salary gap and sexual harassment (admittedly, as a male
graduate student coming up with these isn’t as easy as it might sound,
given that privilegedly they aren’t really part of my lived experience).
With those data, making visualizations now turns to the technical side,
as described below.</p>
<p>As discussed in the class, many visualization techniques can be
broadly characterized as either deceptive or earnest. The earnest ones
in my opinion are easier to identify, because as long as a technique
requires pulling out more work without distorting the original form it
can be defined as earnest. The work can include citing a credible
source, finding more comprehensive data, highlighting the most important
parts, etc. Deceptive techniques, on the other hand, can sometimes be a
bit hard to characterize. There are, of course, deceptive techniques
that are easy to identify. For instance, the salary gap in Figure 2 is
obviously deceptive: even though the average wages of women and men with
similar backgrounds are close, women and men do not distribute similarly
in factors such as job titles and industry types. But there are also
techniques that I found hard to characterize as deceptive or not. For
instance, 1.64% of women have doctoral degrees, while 2.45% of men do.
The absolute difference (i.e., 2.45% - 1.64% = 0.81%) is small, so if we
draw them on a scale of 0-100%, their difference seems negligible;
however, the relative difference is huge (i.e., 2.45% / 1.64% = 1.49),
so a normalized scale would significantly enlarge the difference. I
found it hard to figure out which is the “right” way (and by
implication, the other one would be deceptive) of representing the
difference, mostly because I don’t really know <em>if the difference
actually matters</em>–if it does matter, then hiding it would be
deceptive; if it does not, then enlarging it is the crime.</p>
<p>The example above brings me to the reflection of “what is ethical
analysis and visualization.” Even though we cannot know a priori whether
a technique is deceptive in a completely objective manner (e.g., we
might actually believe the difference between women and men with
doctoral degrees does matter, but in actuality it does not), but as long
as a visualization designer has the intent to be honest with themselves
and others, and keeps an open mind to correcting one’s mistakes, the
analysis and visualization are ethical.</p>
