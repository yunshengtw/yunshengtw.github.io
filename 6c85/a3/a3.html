(6.C85 Assignment 3)</h1>

<h2 id="phase-one-sketching-visualizations">Phase One: Sketching
Visualizations</h2>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: What are the age and gender demographics
in 1900 and 2000 in the U.S., and the differences between the years?</p>
<h3 id="sketch-1">Sketch 1</h3>
<p><img src="./img/line.jpg" width="500" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> A line chart depicting the male and female
population by age in 1900 and 2000, respectively.</p>
<h4 id="design-rationale">Design rationale</h4>
<ul>
<li>At first I thought a line chart might be a good way to convey the
overall trend and highlight important points (e.g., annotating the
gender difference in older groups in 2000). However, it later occurs to
me that line charts doesn’t seem to be a good fit for categorical data
(i.e., what does the lines between two dots even mean?)</li>
<li>One downside of using a single scale for the population of 1900 and
2000 is that the age distribution and gender difference less trivial for
the former, as essentially it only uses about half of the chart
area.</li>
<li>The separation of males and females makes the gender difference
obvious. On the other hand, such separation makes it harder to grasp the
age distribution of the entire population (i.e., the viewers would have
to mentally sum up the blue line and the red line on their own).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sketch-2">Sketch 2</h3>
<p><img src="./img/bar.jpg" width="500" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 2.</strong> A bar chart showing the population (in bar
length) and the gender ratio (in bar color) of each age group in 1900
and 2000, respectively. The density of the strokes in the color map
represents the color saturation.</p>
<h4 id="design-rationale-1">Design rationale</h4>
<ul>
<li>Bar chart is more natural to represent categorical data.</li>
<li>Unlike Sketch 1, using different scales for the populations of 1900
and 2000 makes both distributions clear to the viewers. However, it also
makes the comparison between the total populations harder to perform. To
address this, I added an annotation for the total population.</li>
<li>Compared to Sketch 1 where the gender difference is depicted with
<em>line distance</em>, using <em>color saturation</em> in this sketch
seems to be less effective to convey the gender difference in each
group. Additionally, we lose precision when grouping the differences in
bins. On the other hand, I do think that color does a better job in
conveying the overall message (e.g., in 2000, there are slightly more
males than females in younger groups, and much more females than males
in older groups).</li>
<li>One downside of this representation is that it’s hard to see the
gender ratio for groups with low population (e.g., 90-up in 1900).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sketch-3">Sketch 3</h3>
<p><img src="./img/pie.jpg" width="500" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 3.</strong> A pie chart showing the population (in
slice area) and the gender ratio (in slice color) in 1900 and 2000,
respectively. The density of the strokes in the color map represents the
color saturation.</p>
<h4 id="design-rationale-2">Design rationale</h4>
<ul>
<li>Using two pies of different size makes the difference in total
population immediately clear.</li>
<li>One advantage over the first two sketches is that the group
description (e.g., 0-5) is just beside the corresponding data, making it
easier to query the population of a specific group.</li>
<li>Pie charts have an additional advantage that it’s easier to infer
the cumulative sum (e.g., what percentage of the population falls within
the age group of 15-50).</li>
<li>Using <em>area</em> to indicate the population is less effective
than <em>position</em> as used in Sketch 1 (the line chart) and
<em>length</em> in Sketch 2 (the bar chart).</li>
<li>Similarly to Sketch 2, this representation makes it hard to see the
gender ratio for groups with low population (e.g., 90-up in 1900).</li>
<li>One crucial downside of the chart is that the overall trend (e.g.,
population decreases over age faster in 1900 than in 2000, and an
interesting increase in the 35-45 age group in 2000) becomes much less
obvious compared to the first two sketches.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reflection">Reflection</h3>
<p>One thing I’ve learned while making and assessing the sketches is
<strong>how the clarity of the messages we wish to convey depends
heavily on the design choices we make</strong>. For instance, if we’re
trying to show the difference between populations in 1900 and 2000, then
a common scale for population as used in Sketch 1 would be preferred;
however, if we’re trying to show the overall population distribution
within 1900 and 2000 respectively, then a separate scale as used in
Sketch 2 would do a better job. For another example, if the precise
gender difference within an age group is the goal, then Sketch 1 might
be the best option, as viewers can measure the line distance between a
pair of blue and red dots; if we want viewers to quickly observe the
overall age distribution and gender ratio, then Sketch 2 seems to be the
best fit; if the ability to compute population in a wider range of age
is what we aim for, then Sketch 3 should facilitate that with the
ability to combine the pie slices. Another thing I’ve learned is
<strong>different kinds of information can interfere with each
other</strong>. For instance, in Sketches 2 and 3, we’ve seen that
gender ratio becomes unclear in age groups with low population (e.g.,
90-up in 1900). In this case, population decides how much length or area
in which gender ratio can be expressed.</p>
<h2 id="phase-two-final-design">Phase Two: Final Design</h2>
<p><img src="./img/a3.svg" width="800" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 4.</strong> A bar chart showing the population (in bar
length) and the gender ratio (in bar color) of each age group in 1900
and 2000, respectively.</p>
<h3 id="design-process-design-decisions">Design Process &amp; Design
Decisions</h3>
<p>The goal of this visualization is to reveal the overall age and
gender demographics in 1900 and 2000 respectively, as well as the
contrast between the two years. Eventually I based my final design on
Sketch 2 for it turns out to disclose some interesting facts/trends more
directly. Concretely, the use of a divergent color scheme makes the
imbalance of gender ratio among younger and older age groups in 2000
immediately obvious; the fact that the bars in 1900 shorten more rapidly
than in 2000 suggests the demographic structures are quite different in
the two years; the abrupt increase for the 35-50 age groups hints at
some important events (Baby Boom in this case) happened in the past.</p>
<p>The final design generally follows Sketch 2 in phase 1, so here I’ll
simply elaborate on the details and differences. Overall, I followed the
general style as in the <a
href="https://github.com/matze/mtheme">mtheme</a> Beamer theme. I chose
<a href="https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/data/colourschemes.pdf">Paul
Tol’s color scheme</a>, since it seems most aesthetically pleasing to
me. However, the default color map seems a bit ambiguous especially for
the middle two colors, so I tune the color intensity a bit to try to
make them more distinct. The resulting color map has improved, but still
not satisfactory. Another design choice is whether the bars should have
outlines? I think no, as the outlines are not particularly helpful
except in distinguishing bars in the same age group for 1900 and 2000;
however, a tiny gap between the two axes would do the work as well. As
for the text description of the color map, I actually like the one in
Sketch 2 more, but I haven’t found a way to draw it nicely with
TikZ/pgfplots, the software used to draw the final design. Finally, I
added dim grid lines to make the comparison easier to be made.</p>
<h3 id="reflection-1">Reflection</h3>
<p>I think creating and evaluating the sketches has indeed helped me
with the final design. Sketching allows for the visual comparison of
different design choices in a timely manner. By assessing them, I’m able
to clarify the trade offs of each design choice, and the messages I
actually want to convey to the viewers. Sketching also helps in
strengthening or falsifying my design assumptions (i.e., it looks good
in my imagination, but how about it on paper?).</p>
